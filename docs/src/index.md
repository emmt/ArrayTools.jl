# Introduction

`ArrayTools` is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package which provides a
number of methods and types to deal with the variety of array types (sub-types
of `AbstractArray`) that exist in Julia and to help building custom array-like
types without sacrificing performances.

`ArrayTools` is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/emmt/ArrayTools.jl).
