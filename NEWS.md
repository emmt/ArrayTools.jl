# User visible changes in `ArrayTools` package

## Version 0.2.3

- New `to_type(T,x)` method to convert argument `x` to type `T` with a type
  assertion on the result.

## Version 0.2.2

- Documentation has been improved.

- Some code ahs been simplified.


## Version 0.2.1

- `isfastarray` and `isflatarray` deprecated in favor of `is_fast_array` and
  `is_flat_array` which are more readable and thus less confusing.  `fastarray`
  and `flatarray` deprecated in favor of `to_fast_array` and `to_flat_array`
  which are more clear about their purpose.

- New method `same_size` to get the common size of arrays checking that they
  all have the same size.

- `same_dimensions` deprecated in favor of `same_standard_size` which is more
  explicit.

- `check_dimensions` deprecated in favor of `check_size` which yields the
  number of elements and throws an `ArgumentError` exception if not all
  dimensions are nonnegative.

- `dimensions(A::AbstractArray)` has been deprecated in favor of
  `standard_size(A)` while `dimensions` has been deprecated in favor of
  `to_size` for other types of arguments.  Union `Dimensions` has been
  deprecated favor of `ArraySize`.

- New method `to_int` for quick conversion of values to `Int`.

- `bcastdim` and `bcastdims` have been deprecated in favor of `bcastsize`.

- `checkdimensions` has been deprecated in favor of `check_dimensions`.

- Rubber index operator `â€¦` has been renamed as `..` (which is easier to type) as in
  [`EllipsisNotation`](https://github.com/ChrisRackauckas/EllipsisNotation.jl).
